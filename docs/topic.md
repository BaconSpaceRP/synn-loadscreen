# Synn's simple loadingscreen

Hello, I've been working on a simple loading screen for about a week. My goal was to set up a loadingscreen that was configurable, easy to  setup and mostly multi-stage loadingbars.
I hope you find this release handy, **if you have any issues or feature requests, let me know.**

## Customizing

You can of course customize the resource to your liking. To customize the loading screen you can open the `progressbar-config.js` located in the `js/` folder. In there the options should be clearly documented on what they do.

In order to customize the colors of the loadingbar, you can edit the `colors.css` located in the `css/` folder.
