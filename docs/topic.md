# Synn's simple loadingscreen

Hello, I've been working on a simple loading screen for about a week. My goal was to set up a loadingscreen that was configurable, easy to  setup, multi-stage loadingbars and a no non-sense approach.
I hope you find this release handy.

## Customizing

You can of course customize the resource to your liking. To customize the loading screen you can open the `config.js` located in the `js/` folder. In there the options should be clearly documented on what they do.

In order to customize the colors of the loadingbar, you can edit the `colors.css` located in the `css/` folder.
Here you can edit the RGB values.
